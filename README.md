# GWASpoly

GWASpoly was originally developed by Umesh Rosyara and Jeffrey Endelman, as documented in their 2016 publication titled "Software for genome-wide association studies in autopolyploids" (PubMed ID: 27898814). The tool was designed to address the unique challenges of conducting GWAS in autopolyploid species, which differ significantly from diploids in terms of allele dosage and inheritance patterns.
